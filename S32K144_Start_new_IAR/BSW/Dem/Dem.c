/* module specific MISRA deviations:

   MD_DEM_1.1_612
     Description: Rule 1.1
                  All code shall conform to ISO 9899:1990 C programming language, ISO 9899, amended and corrected by
                  ISO/IEC 9899/COR1:1995, ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, and ISO/IEC 9899/COR2: 1996
     Reason:      Depending on the configuration size the generated tables can
                  exceed the C90 limit of 32767 bytes
     Risk:        Compilation error.
     Prevention:  Compiler compatibility must be tested during integration.

   MD_DEM_5.1
     Description: Rule 5.1
                  Identifiers (internal and external) shall not rely on the significance of more than 31 characters.
     Reason:      The API is standardized and a change would break compliance.
     Risk:        Compilation errors are possible.
     Prevention:  Compiler compatibility is tested during integration.

   MD_DEM_8.5:
     Description: Rule 8.5
                  There shall be no definitions of objects or functions in a header file.
     Reason:      Subcomponent structure is implemented in header files. The implementation files can be identified by
                  their name ending in _Implementation.h
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.7:
     Description: Rule 8.7
                  Objects shall be defined at block scope if they are only accessed from within a single function.
     Reason:      Vector style guide prevents usage of static variables in function scope
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.8_dcm:
     Description: Rule 8.8
                  An external object or function shall be declared in one and only one file.
     Reason:      MICROSAR Dcm generates all prototypes of functions used. This leads to duplicate definitions.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_8.8_schm:
     Description: Rule 8.8
                  An external object or function shall be declared in one and only one file.
     Reason:      MICROSAR SchM generates prototypes of Dem_<X>MainFunction(). This leads to duplicate definitions.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_11.1:
     Decription:  Rule 11.1
                  Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to a function and any type other than an integral type.
     Reason:      Different types of callback functions need to be supported through a generic mechanism
     Risk:        Functions are cast to the wrong type before calling.
     Prevention:  The correct function type is indicated by type tagging. The correct cast is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_11.4_cpy:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Use of memcopy/memset requires common pointer type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_inh:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Use of inheritance pattern requires cast to specific class type.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_nvm:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Mechanism for Nv handling requires common pointer type
     Risk:        None. Pointers are initially aligned and only cast due to common API later on.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.4_sr:
     Description: Rule 11.4
                  A cast should not be performed between a pointer to object type and a different pointer to object
                  type.
     Reason:      Serialization of typed data.
     Risk:        Data corruption due to miscast.
     Prevention:  Covered by descriptive pointer types and code review for correct usage.

   MD_DEM_11.5:
     Description: Rule 11.5
                  A cast shall not be performed that removes any const or volatile qualification from the type
                  addressed by a pointer.
     Reason:      MemSet and MemCpy are defined as taking an unqualified pointer.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  Safe access of shared data is verified during code review.

   MD_DEM_12.4_cs:
     Description: Rule 12.4
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain side effects
     Reason:      The function must be called in a critical section, so the access to volatile variables does not
                  apply as side effect.
     Risk:        Additional calls might be introduces later outside the critical section.
     Prevention:  Requirement for critical section is documented and compliance is assured during code review.

   MD_DEM_12.4_cf:
     Description: Rule 12.4
                  The right hand operand of a logical && or || operator shall not contain side effects
     Reason:      The function called on the right hand side has no side effects.
     Risk:        The function may introduce side effects at a later time.
     Prevention:  Code analysis (e.g. MISRA).

   MD_DEM_13.3:
     Description: Rule 13.3
                  Floating-point expressions shall not be tested for equality or inequality.
     Reason:      Test for generatad special value.
     Risk:        None
     Prevention:  Correctness is ensured in test suite.

   MD_DEM_13.7:
     Description: Rule 13.7
                  Boolean operations whose results are invariant shall not be permitted.
     Reason:      The expression is not invariant. Depending on supported features invariant value is possible but
                  the resulting code modification will adversely affect maintainability of already complicated code
                  paths.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings or compiler errors depending on configuration.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1_ACCESSOR
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  Static function '%s()' is not used within this translation unit.
     Reason:      Accessor function ('getter', 'setter') is present although no code is actively using it.
                  Accessor functions do not provide functionality, and are not conditionally compiled to increase
                  maintainability.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings depending on configuration.
                  No reduced code size with a special configuration, not realized optimization.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1_LIB
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  Static function '%s()' is not used within this translation unit.
     Reason:      Function is present although no code is actively using it. Function is used as library function 
                  and is therefore always available. 
     Risk:        Compiler warnings depending on configuration.
                  No reduced code size with a special configuration, not realized optimization.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.1:
     Description: Rule 14.1
                  This switch default label is unreachable.
     Reason:      Switch default labels are mandatory due to mandatory MISRA rule 15.3 'The final clause of a switch
                  statement shall be the default clause.'.
     Risk:        Compiler warnings or compiler errors depending on configuration.
                  Default branch cannot be tested.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.2:
     Description: Rule 14.2
                  All non-null statements shall either (i) have at least one side-effect however executed, or
                  (ii) cause control flow to change
     Reason:      This statement is used to avoid warnings caused by unused parameters. Parameters are defined by
                  standardized API requirements, and not needed in case a feature is disabled by configuration.
                  It is either impossible due to API standardization or necessary code duplication (severe maintenance
                  increase) to provide feature dependent APIs with different signatures.
     Risk:        Unavoidable compiler warning or error because of either unused statements or unused parameter.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.5:
     Description: Rule 14.5
                  The continue statement shall not be used
     Reason:      The continue statement is used in a circumstance where a different approach would reduce efficiency
                  or maintainability due to increased complexity.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.6_err:
     Description: Rule 14.6
                  For any iteration statement there shall be at most one break statement used for loop termination.
     Reason:      The loop needs multiple exit points since error conditions cannot be verified prior to the loop.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_14.6_opt:
     Description: Rule 14.6
                  For any iteration statement there shall be at most one break statement used for loop termination.
     Reason:      Increased efficiency on the time critical path
     Risk:        Maintainability is adversely affected.
     Prevention:  The break statement is documented.

   MD_DEM_14.7:
     Description: Rule 14.7
                  A function shall have a single point of exit at the end of the function.
     Reason:      Due to maintainability problems the control flow through the function shall not be complicated even
                  further.
     Risk:        Maintainability is adversely affected.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_15.2:
     Description: Rule 15.2
                  An unconditional break statement shall terminate every non-empty switch clause.
     Reason:      The fall-through is preferred to an if-else cascade to avoid code duplication in this particular
                  circumstance.
     Risk:        Adverse effect on maintainability.
     Prevention:  The fall-through is documented.

   MD_DEM_16.4_dcm:
     Description: Rule 16.4
                  The identifiers used in the declaration and definition of a function shall be identical
     Reason:      Dcm generates its own prototypes based on a generic algorithm.
     Risk:        Dcm prototypes can deviate from the implementation.
     Prevention:  Verify compatibility during integraton tests.

   MD_DEM_16.4_rte:
     Description: Rule 16.4
                  The identifiers used in the declaration and definition of a function shall be identical
     Reason:      Port-Defined arguments are not generated with the correct name. This can currently not be influenced
                  due to the RTE being a third party module.
     Risk:        None. The generated prototypes are never used directly but only from generated RTE code.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The API is standardized and a change would break compliance.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7_False:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The data behind the pointer is modified, or modified in some configurations. This is a false positive.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7_Internal:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The API has to be compatible to a common prototype
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.7_Design:
     Description: Rule 16.7
                  A pointer parameter in a function prototype should be declared as pointer to const if the pointer is
                  not used to modify the addressed object.
     Reason:      The function has write access to shared state. The caller may not rely on constancy. Even if the
                  current implementation does not need write access, this is allowed to change. A stable interface is
                  preferred to adhering to this rule.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_16.9_fp:
     Description: Rule 16.9
                  A function identifier shall only be used with either a preceding &, or with a parenthesised parameter
                  list, which may be empty.
     Reason:      There is a preceeding &, and the use as a function pointer is intended
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_19_7:
     Description: Rule 19.7
                  A function should be used in preference to a function-like macro. 
     Reason:      The calculation result is used on preprocessor level
     Risk:        Resulting code is difficult to understand or may not work as expected.
     Prevention:  Code inspection and test of the different variants in the component test. 

   MD_DEM_19.13:
     Description: Rule 19.13
                  K&R compilers do not support the ISO glue operator '##'.
     Reason:      This kind of implementation creates the least MISRA warnings.
     Risk:        K&R compilers will not work.
     Prevention:  Integration test using target compiler, error directives to detect evaluation errors.

   MD_DEM_19.15:
     Description: Rule 19.15
                  Precautions shall be taken in order to prevent the contents of a header file being included twice.
     Reason:      Precautions HAVE been taken, this violation is a false positive.
     Risk:        None.
     Prevention:  None.

   MD_DEM_20.2:
     Description: Rule 20.2
                  The names of standard library macros, objects and functions shall not be reused.
     Reason:      Included from vector standard library.
     Risk:        Name collision with different standard library.
     Prevention:  None.

                  Dem_Debounce<DEBOUNCING_ALGORITHM>_InfoType structure. In these functions, the Dem_Debounce<ALGORITHM_SPECIFIC>_InfoType
                  structure is completely initialized.
                  For initializing the Dem_DebounceBase_InfoType structure contained within the Dem_Debounce<ALGORITHM_SPECIFIC>_InfoType 
                  structure, the Dem_DebounceBase_InfoInitDefault function is invoked with a valid pointer to this

  \DESCRIPTION    A pointer to a DestinationBuffer structure is locally allocated and passed to Dem_Data_InitDestinationBuffer

                  initialized to the corresponding buffer size.
                  The buffer pointer can be received
                  - via a *Dcm API. It is the responsibility of the Dcm
                    to pass a valid destination buffer and matching size.
                  - from an application API with size information. It is the responsibility of the application to pass a valid
                    destination buffer and matching size.
                  - from internal function Dem_MemoryEntry_GetExtendedRecordDataPtr(). This function will always return a valid pointer.
                    In this case the corresponding size is queried with function Dem_Cfg_GlobalERecMaxRawSize().
                  - from internal function Dem_Mem_RingBufferNormalRatePtr(). This function will always return a valid pointer.
                    In this case the corresponding size is queried with function Dem_Cfg_GlobalTimeSeriesNormalBufferSize().
                  - from internal function Dem_Mem_RingBufferFastRatePtr(). This function will always return a valid pointer.
                    In this case the corresponding size is queried with function Dem_Cfg_GlobalTimeSeriesFastBufferSize().
                  - as argument with corresponding size in an internal function. The internal function passes the pointer to destination buffer 
                    and size without modifying to function Dem_Data_InitDestinationBuffer. The caller of the internal function ensures that pointer
                    and size of buffer are valid.

  \DESCRIPTION    A function passes a pointer to an element in array Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoType<X>.SatelliteExtendedData[] and a new value to be 
                  set to function Dem_Com_SyncCompareAndSwap(). Pointer and value to be set have the same data type. Dem_Com_SyncCompareAndSwap() 
                  only sets the passed value at the passed pointer position. The pointer references a member of the global struct variable 
                  Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoType<X> and therefore is always valid. In a multi satellite configuration the pointer is taken 
                  from the Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfo table.

  - Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoType<X>.MaxDebounceValues[]

  E.g. for a line in table Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfo 
  { 37U, ..., &Dem_Cfg_GetSatelliteInfoOsApplication_Master().MaxDebounceValues[0], ..., 
  &Dem_Cfg_GetSatelliteInfoOsApplication_Master().SatelliteData[0], &Dem_Cfg_GetSatelliteInfoOsApplication_Master().SatelliteExtendedData[0] },
  where 37 is the EventCount, the structure Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoTypeOsApplication_Master should be generated as follows:
  typedef struct Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoTypeOsApplication_Master_s {
  volatile Dem_SatelliteData_DataType         SatelliteData[ 37 ];
  volatile Dem_SatelliteData_ExtendedDataType SatelliteExtendedData[ 37 ];
  volatile Dem_Cfg_MaxDebounceValuesType      MaxDebounceValues[ 37 ];
  }                                                                     Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoTypeOsApplication_Master;

  - &Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoType<X>.DebounceLoResTimer
  - &Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoType<X>.SatelliteStatus

  I.e. the pointers in table Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfo should be generated the following way for all satellites:
  {  ..., &Dem_Cfg_GetSatelliteInfo<X>().DebounceLoResTimer, &Dem_Cfg_GetSatelliteInfo<X>().SatelliteStatus, ... }
  and the structures Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfo<X> should be generated as follows:
  typedef struct Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfo<X>_s {
  volatile Dem_Com_ProcessorWordType          SatelliteStatus;
  Dem_Cfg_DebounceLoResTimerType              DebounceLoResTimer;
  }                                                                     Dem_Cfg_SatelliteInfoType<X>;

  In a single satellite configuration the user shall verify that the pointers returned by the function 
  like macros Dem_Cfg_GetDebounceLoResTimerOfSatelliteInfo() resp. Dem_Cfg_GetSatelliteStatusOfSatelliteInfo()
